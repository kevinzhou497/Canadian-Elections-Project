# Canadian-Elections-Project

Hi! This project contains the code that creates a bar graph as well as a kNN machine learning model using data from previous Canadian parliamentary elections. 

The dataset used for this project can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/canadian-federal-election-results-timeseries. 

The dataset provides information on the Canadian House of Commons elections, with data from seven previous elections that have occurred within the last 20 years. The problem statement is: what factors are good indicators of whether or not a candidate is elected? The bar graph examines how much ballot sequence number, also known as ballot position, corresponds with electoral success, and the kNN model examines the usefulness of a candidate's occupation in predicting electoral success. 

Write ups for the bar graph and the kNN model that detail methadology and conclusions from the results can be found underneath the visualizations in the Jupyter notebook that contains the code.
